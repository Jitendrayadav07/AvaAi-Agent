After the acquisition of Stars Arena on November 4th, I barely slept for the next 3 weeks. </p><p>Our backs were against the wall with continued exploits, a website that was down, an ongoing wallet migration, and a nervous userbase that lost everything and put all their hope in me for a recovery.  I had to finish a contentious acquisition, build a team in real time, secure the platform, secure capital, rebrand the app, and convince people to give me a chance to right the ship and still trust the platform when everyone else had left. The transition process was one of the most difficult periods I’ve ever experienced in my life.</p><p>I took my first night off for Thanksgiving but it was difficult to enjoy the time with everything lingering on my mind. The rebuild seemed impossible back then. It was such a steep mountain to climb to get people to trust using this app again. The SocialFi euphoria had come and went. That night was the first and only time I questioned the decision to take over the platform. </p><p>Fast forward one year to this Thanksgiving. Entire app secured and rebuilt with a V2 overhaul. Top web3 partnerships from all chains. Memecoin tipping. Badges. Solana integration. The social exchange. Dozens of viral campaigns. Countless bug fixes and optimizations. One of the best airdrops of 2024. <span class=\"currency\">$ARENA</span> staking. Governance votes. A native Arena App Store. Arena Stages outcompeting X spaces. Amazing investors backing us. One of the best teams in the space. A community that most platforms can only dream of. <span class=\"currency\">$100M</span> in total volume. User metrics at all time highs and on the verge of breaking out. </p><p>A year ago it was unlikely that we’d survive. Now, it’s hard to see us not being the<span class=\"hashtag\"> #1</span> social crypto app around. Most of the apps we were competing with back then are no longer around. But The Arena is only just getting started now. </p><p>All I can feel now is deep gratitude. I’m thankful for the community who believed this was possible when no one else did. I’m thankful for my team who grinds to make this vision a reality. I’m thankful for those who backed us and supported us. I’m thankful that I get to wake up everyday and build the future with all of you. </p><p>I’m thankful for the community builders who will make this platform bigger than we ever can. I’m thankful for <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/avax\" data-user-handle=\"avax\">@avax</a> and <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/AvalancheFDN\" data-user-handle=\"AvalancheFDN\">@AvalancheFDN</a> and the support they always give because without them this would not be possible. Im thankful for everyone’s patience in letting us build out the vision in a space where meta’s change every few hours. I’m thankful for all the lessons this space has taught me over the years. I’m thankful for the dark times where we grew stronger and were able to build the proper foundation. </p><p>I hope to continue to grow as a leader. I hope that we never forget why we started this journey in the first place. Early Arena users will earn a lot of money on this app, but we have the opportunity to do something much bigger. To build something truly special. Let’s not take this for granted. </p><p>In The Arena we trust ⚔️</p>",

A place where you can buy gifts while using social media and collect airdrop points while having fun and doing activities. So, you seem to be asking, how can I accumulate airdrop points? First of all, you need to expand your Avax transaction volume, either with the Avax fees you receive when your tickets are purchased. You can either do this by installing Avax into the application. 69 arena tokens will be given for each Airdrop point earned. So how do ticket prices increase? First of all, ticket prices for active people, accounts with Avax in their wallets, active accounts and profiles with high followers at x usually increase. Tickets start at an initial ticket price of 0.0064 Avax and can rise indefinitely. </p><p>In short, you can get tips, accumulate airdrop points and increase your Avax while using social media. Welcome back to the arena, the application where all of these come together.</p>",

Here are a few value propositions I’ve written about <br/><br/>- More ways for content creators to monetize. Cutting out the web2 middle men.  <br/>- Smaller content creators can leverage existing influence and crypto economic incentives to gain a following, i.e. larger content creators buy smaller content creator tickets and have an incentive to promote them transparently. <br/>- Brands can interact directly with their biggest supporters <br/>- Good vibes and networking when buying tickets to join a group and likeminded community. <br/><br/>What are some of your favorite new business models The Arena can enable? Gimme ur best and I’ll buy ur ticket :)",

Make sure to build your own castle too!</p><p>- Do not ask people to buy your ticket, you look stupid and desperate.</p><p>- Interact with other people by replying and quote retweeting, this way you will get seen. If you are a likable guy/girl you have a better chance on the market.</p><p>- Buy tickets mfer</p><p>- Suck <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/jasonmdesimone\" data-user-handle=\"jasonmdesimone\">@jasonmdesimone</a>'s dick whatever happens</p><p>- Make sure to attend The Shitpost Hours with <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/AveryBigweapon\" data-user-handle=\"AveryBigweapon\">@AveryBigweapon</a> as the host.</p><p>- It doesn't matter how much money he loses, Bob Mendez is a molester.</p><p>- Be active and consistent.</p><p>- Buy the right tickets to get acces to certain people and use that to network. Who knows, maybe you find a way to grow faster. Good friends can really bring you far.</p><p>- Make sure to either be yourself or to play a good character. Be who you wanna be, it's the fucking internet homie. So make sure whatever you do, make sure it puts you on the map.</p><p>- Stick to good people and don't be afraid to be picky, because most people on the Internet are just a bunch of bums. Focus on finding people who can learn you shit and help you grow as a person. Knowledge is everything, if you're reading this mfer, you make sure to fucking chase knowledge. Build yourself mfer.</p><p>- Participate in drama, it will make people see you and if done right even talk about you. Like I said before, you can play a character or maybe even advocate of the devil to pull a reaction. It's funny and that work.</p><p>- If you want to network with a good strategist/trader, I recommend buying <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/Vega0x\" data-user-handle=\"Vega0x\">@Vega0x</a> his ticket. That guy knows exactly what he is doing and guides people in his discord. Also ticket holders get acces to the discord. If you join just know that you don't wanna act dumb in there. He is a heartless mfer and doesn't hesitates to either roast you and/or kick you out. But he a good guy, made good money by just following what he does. Buy his ticket.</p><p>- Make sure to make profit on here, do not fall for the \"I don't wanna sell my friends\". Like <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/almostowenmusic\" data-user-handle=\"almostowenmusic\">@almostowenmusic</a> did, because It's a lie you tell to yourself and it will financially fuck you. Maybe Owen is in a good position now, I just know he will fuck it up because his mind is on buying friends and force them to listen to his music. So, When you're in a good profit just sell and try to find a good deal. Paperhand that shit. Also make sure to never even think about buying his ticket. Make that $$$</p><p>- Post good shit, not these long ass rants I am making right now. I'm just keeping it real. Most people won't even come this far.</p><p>- Honestly If you don't want to fuck up your growth on this app, I recommend to not interact with @Iamamystreet, she is very toxic and feministic towards men. I have been speculating that she is a man hating lesbo. It's just what I think. Definitely none of my business.</p><p>- Best thing you can do to grow is being loyal to the shitpost hours spaces. For the people who don't know what that is, I will explain it shortly. So basically it's a place where people say what they want when they want to whoever they want, without getting banned. We talk and have conversations about a lot of nothing. The most important aspect about that space is that it attracts people with actual opinion, rather than listening to all those guys who talk like their balls are tied up and act like they are \"That Guy\" while they are just a bunch of fucking losers who haven't seen anything in life. So if you want real you should follow <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/AveryBigweapon\" data-user-handle=\"AveryBigweapon\">@AveryBigweapon</a>, he is the host and currently retired. So my goal is to get him back so he can host that shit again.</p><p>- Just know that I am the king, but I will still help anyone who needs it. Just talk to me mfer. I'm useless af, but I would still try.</p><p>If you made it here you should be wise and educated, in 7 day you can pickup you Arena certificate at your local postal office.</p><p>Bye mfer</p>",

    "tweet": "<p>The Arena’s TVL is currently only <span class=\"currency\">$1</span> million. When it was hacked last year, TVL was at <span class=\"currency\">$3</span> million. Right now, no one is buying or selling tickets, but when the first signs of the bull market start to show, things here will catch fire. By February, ARENA’s TVL will likely surpass <span class=\"currency\">$50</span> million. Tickets that are now priced at 1-2 AVAX will be selling for 40-50 AVAX. By February, AVAX will likely be over $150.</p><p>All of this will happen within just three months. When it’s all over, many of us will look back and say, “Wow, we missed so many opportunities.” Only a few can foresee what’s coming. Once the fuse is lit, everything will happen very quickly. Just like no one wants to buy tickets now, when the time comes, no one will want to sell their tickets, but by then, it’ll be too late.</p><p>It’s very possible to multiply your money 100x, 200x, or even 1000x in ARENA within three months. We are still at the beginning. You don’t need a lot of money—you need trust. ARENA is a culture. You don’t have to be wealthy, but you must be trustworthy. Focus on building a strong community here. Secure your spot now. When things take off, those with money will trust you and will want to join or support the network and community you’ve built.</p><p>Don’t rush. At the end of the day, our goal is to make money. Don’t think small. Eventually, you’ll want to sell your tickets. But don’t buy anyone’s tickets in bulk, and never dump a large number of tickets on someone all at once. No matter how much you trust someone, never buy more than three tickets from them. This will make you more reliable.</p><p>We’ll discuss this in more detail in the coming days. Stay safe.</p>",

They've now hit a 1.35 bribe efficiency. This means that, as of writing, communities can bribe their LP with <span class=\"currency\">$1</span> and that will direct ~$1.35 in PHAR emissions to that pair through vote incentives. </p><p>🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥</p><p>Let's break that down.</p><p>🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥</p><p>Pharaoh is part of The Kingdom, a next gen ve(3,3) dex suite. Native to Avalanche and spearheaded by hardcore red chain builders like <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/LHBCrypto\" data-user-handle=\"LHBCrypto\">@LHBCrypto</a> and <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/TopGunHatch\" data-user-handle=\"TopGunHatch\">@TopGunHatch</a>, Pharaoh has always been about building out meaningful community incentives and making the red chain a better place for all builders and users. </p><p>I will make another post on the weekend about how Pharaoh does this through an incredible revenue generation model, and how ve(3,3)s need good revenue to sustain a healthy bribe economy, but for now I'll assume you are familiar with ve(3,3)s and just say that revenue *far* exceeds their emissions, and they deliver absolutely insane returns to voters. That's what makes all this possible - as a vote briber, you can leverage Pharaoh's revenue generation to make your incentives go further.</p><p>As is standard in ve(3,3)s, users are able to bribe voters to vote for a pool of their choosing. If you are a project lead and want to deepen liquidity for your pools, you can bribe them with incentives and more vePHAR votes will be directed to those pools on epoch flip. Right now, the bribe efficiency is 1.35x, but they're working HARD to increase that in the coming weeks and months🔥</p><p>If you as a project lead or community member use a vePHAR position to vote for that same pool, you can then get some of your incentives back and add them again next week, helping to build LP size and make your incentives go EVEN further 👀</p><p>Shoutout to <a class=\"thread-tag\" href=\"/SwolBeach\" data-user-handle=\"SwolBeach\">@SwolBeach</a> for consistently being the highest bribers oh Pharaoh - they seem to get how this flywheel can benefit them, and have been using it for their community for months now.</p><p>So are you a community member who wants to direct some love to your favourite pools? Are you a project lead who has incentives to give out but wants to amplify them and make them go further? Are you a new user to ve(3,3)s and just want to go try it out and see how you can make it work for you?</p><p>If you wanna learn more go jump in the Pharaoh discord and talk to the Hillbillies, they'll sort you out and make sure that you get the best returns for your liquidity on the good red dorito chain.</p><p>⚔ Btw while you're there peep the <span class=\"currency\">$ARENA</span> pool ⚔</p>",

    "tweet": "It is fair to introduce myself. Name is iakov. <br/>For five years I have been building Midas.Investments, a CeFi platform generating yields on-top of DeFi. Maximum AUM was <span class=\"currency\">$360</span> mln. Model did not work, we closed in December of previous year following the path of Celcius, BlockFi and FTX. It was impossible to build CeFi business, and CeFi model is a piece of shit for various reasons. Our 10x growth in AUM was in the end of 2021, which made us having long-tail of DeFi risk in portfolio in the end of bullish market. We tried many things to keep us alive, but they did not work.<br/>The closure of Midas resulted in net loss for users of approx. 60 mil that was compensated with Midas token, all the remaining funds were distributed to users right away to not go in the long bankruptcy process. Now we are building the decentralized asset management protocol Locus.Finance, which aims to build the first omnichain vaults. The idea is to give retail users the access to the best investment opportunities in DeFi across all EVM chains and protocols. <br/>Midas tokens will be swapped to Locus tokens, so this is our chance to make things right fixing our mistakes with our expertise of building accessible products for retail. <br/>I am the man of vision. I see how DeFi can create the new layer of democratisation of wealth in the next 10 years. The traditional financial system is shit and favours only the institutions. Humanity deserves to have access to the sources of wealth accumulation and possibility to borrow and leverage on this tools. This is what we will build. <br/>I also dig integral theory, cognitive science, contemplative spirituality, gaming and, of course, DeFi, the love of my work life.<br/>Pleasure to be here, connecting with you, guys.",
